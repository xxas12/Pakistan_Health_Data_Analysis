## Scenario

The provided dataset represents detailed information on patient visits, including
personal and medical data, to explore patient demographics to understand the
distribution of age, gender, height, and weight across different hospitals.
The analysis will also involve comparing hospital performance based on patient
volume and treatment costs, identifying peak times for admissions and discharges, and
examining the impact of insurance coverage on healthcare expenses. By studying the
distribution of blood groups and gaining geographical insights, it will uncover patterns and
correlations that can inform healthcare providers and policymakers, ultimately contributing to
improved healthcare services and outcomes in Pakistan.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 2000 rows and 15 columns, representing health-related data from various
hospitals in Pakistan. Each row corresponds to a patient's visit to a hospital, including personal
and medical information. Here are the details of each column:

* **Hospital Name:** Name of the hospital where the patient was treated.
* **Patient Name:** Full name of the patient.
* **Age:** Age of the patient in years.
* **Gender:** Gender of the patient (Male or Female).
* **Date of Admission:** Date when the patient was admitted to the hospital (YYYY-MM-DD format).
* **Date of Discharge:** Date when the patient was discharged from the hospital (YYYY-MM-DD format).
* **Disease:** The primary disease or condition for which the patient was treated.
* **Treatment Cost:** Cost of the treatment in PKR (Pakistani Rupees).
* **Insurance:** Whether the patient had insurance coverage (Yes or No).
* **Blood Group:** Blood group of the patient.
* **Height (cm):** Height of the patient in centimeters.
* **Weight (kg):** Weight of the patient in kilograms.
* **Contact Number:** Contact number of the patient.
* **City:** City where the patient resides.
* **Province:** Province where the patient resides.

## Objective:
* Analyze patient demographics to understand the age, gender, height, and weight distribution across various hospitals.
* Evaluate disease prevalence to identify the most common diseases treated in hospitals and their distribution across different cities and provinces.
*  Examine healthcare costs by assessing the treatment costs associated with different diseases and hospitals, and understanding the financial burden on patients with and without insurance.
*  Study hospital performance by comparing patient volume, treatment costs, and other key metrics across hospitals.
*  Identify patterns in hospital admissions and discharges to determine peak times and optimize resource allocation and management.
* Conduct an insurance coverage analysis to understand the percentage of patients with insurance coverage and its impact on treatment costs.
* Explore the distribution of blood groups among patients and its relevance to healthcare services.
* Gain geographical insights into patient distribution and healthcare needs across different cities and provinces in Pakistan.
* Investigate potential correlations between patient demographics (e.g., age) and treatment costs.
*  Enable data-driven decision making for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers to improve healthcare services and outcomes in Pakistan.
